# Android-Project-for-tracking-orientation-of-Device
The goal of this assignment is to understand the use of sensors on the smartphone to design an
app that produces the 3-D orientation of the phone when placed in your pocket. The key is to
use a combination of the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass on the phone to find the 3-D
orientation of the device. The User interface design for the assignment is upto you, but try to
be creative in illustrating the 3D orientation of the device. You need to follow the requirements
mentioned below.


Requirements:                          
• The app should collect accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data in an Activity.               
• The Activity should also define the UI to display the 3D orientation of the device.                     
• The Activity should also implement the algorithm that takes in the three sensor streams,
and generates the 3D orientation of the device.

Please follow this link to see how the different sensor data is fused to find the accurate orientation of the device:
